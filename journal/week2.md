# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

---

## Building Security Metrics, Logs and Tracing 

- from Ashish's Week 2 - Observability Security Considerations

1. Which Application? (Crown Jewels)
2. Type of Application (compute, monoltith, microservice)
3. Threat modelling session.
4. Identity Attack Vectors.
5. Map Attack Vectors to TTP in Attack MITRE Framework
6. Indentity instrumentation agents to create tracing (Cloudwatch, FireLens agent, 3rd party agents, etc)
7. AWS Services like AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) for metrics and traces.
8. Dashboard for **Practical Attack** Vectors only for that application. 
9. Repeat for next Application
